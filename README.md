# Socio-Economic Status and Healthcare Accessibility in Rotterdam

## Overview
This study explores the relationship between socio-economic factors and healthcare accessibility, specifically focusing on emergency ambulance calls in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Existing literature highlights correlations between socio-economic status and healthcare accessibility across different regions, but this research seeks to address the gap in understanding the social gradient of medical services within Dutch cities.

## Background
Several studies have established links between socio-economic status and healthcare utilization:
- **United Kingdom** - Asaria et al. [2] identified a social gradient in hospital admissions.
- **Europe** - Marmot [8] found variations in emergency health services based on socio-economic status.
- **Asia** - Shahidah et al. [1] highlighted spatial gradients in ambulance calls in Singapore.
- **Netherlands** - Storm et al. [11] identified institutional factors contributing to health inequality, emphasizing a lack of collaboration between public health and other policy sectors.

## Research Objective
Despite these findings, little is known about the socio-economic gradient of medical services within Dutch cities. This research focuses on Rotterdam, using machine learning techniques to analyze the relationship between socio-economic factors and ambulance call frequencies.

**Research Question:**
*What is the relationship between the socio-economic status of neighborhoods and the number of ambulance calls in Rotterdam, Netherlands?*

## Methodology
### Data Sources
1. **112 Call Dataset (2017-2020):** Emergency call data from 112-Nederland [10].
2. **CBS Neighborhood Data:** Socio-economic indicators such as income, population density, migration background, and hospital distance [4].

### Analytical Approach
We employed **K-Means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group neighborhoods based on socio-economic characteristics and analyze their relationship with ambulance call frequencies.

## Key Findings
The study uncovered a complex relationship between socio-economic factors and ambulance service use. Key insights include:
- High socio-economic status and proximity to healthcare facilities did not consistently correlate with lower ambulance call frequencies.
- Healthcare accessibility and socio-economic diversity were critical factors influencing emergency service patterns.

## Implications
This research provides actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare planners:
- Emphasizes the need for **equitable and efficient emergency healthcare systems**.
- Highlights the importance of **comprehensive healthcare accessibility**.
- Advocates for urban health policies that account for the diverse nature of healthcare demand.

## Conclusion
By analyzing ambulance call data through the lens of socio-economic diversity, this study sheds light on emergency healthcare accessibility in Rotterdam. The findings stress the importance of integrating socio-economic considerations into healthcare planning to ensure effective and inclusive urban health services.
